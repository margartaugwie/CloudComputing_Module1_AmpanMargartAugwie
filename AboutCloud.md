# What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.

### Core Concepts
1. **On-Demand Self-Service:** You can provision resources whenever you need them without requiring human interaction with the service provider.
2. **Broad Network Access:** Services are available over the network and can be accessed through standard mechanisms (laptops, mobile phones, tablets).
3. **Resource Pooling:** The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model.
4. **Rapid Elasticity:** Resources can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.
5. **Measured Service:** Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth).

### Why it Matters
Cloud computing allows businesses to move faster and lower costs because they don't have to manage the "heavy lifting" of hardware. It fosters innovation by allowing users to experiment with new ideas quickly and at a low cost.
