# Traditional IT vs. Cloud Computing

Traditional IT requires high upfront hardware costs, while cloud computing uses a flexible pay-as-you-go model.
In a traditional setup you must manually maintain physical servers, whereas cloud providers handle all hardware maintenance for you. Finally, scaling resources is slow in traditional systems, but the cloud allows for instant and automatic scaling based on demand.
